# Air Quality Monitoring System

Welcome to the Air Quality Monitoring System for IoT project! This system allows you to monitor and track the air quality in your home or office in real-time using a network of connected sensors and an easy-to-use web app.

### Features

1. Monitor and track air quality metrics such as temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
2. Receive alerts when air quality levels exceed specified thresholds
3. View historical data and trends on a user-friendly dashboard
4. Connect multiple sensors to create a comprehensive monitoring network
5. Easy setup and configuration using the web app

### Hardware Components

1. Raspberry Pi (or similar single-board computer)
2. Sensors for temperature, humidity, CO2, and VOCs
3. WiFi module for connecting to the internet
